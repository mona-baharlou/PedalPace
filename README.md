# 🚴 PedalPace

> **The Intelligent Weather Assistant for Cyclists.** > PedalPace combines deterministic weather physics with **Generative AI** to tell you not just the weather, but how it feels to ride in it.

---

##  Features

* **AI-Powered Pro Tips**: Uses **Google Gemini AI** to provide human-like coaching advice based on current conditions.
* **Cycling Suitability Score**: A custom algorithm that calculates a 0-100 score weighing temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.
* **5-Day Forecast**: Clean, scannable forecast cards designed for quick glance-and-go decision making.
* **recise Location**: Integration with Google Play Services for real-time local weather updates.
* **Modern UI**: Built 100% with **Jetpack Compose** following Material 3 guidelines.

## The AI Engine

Unlike standard weather apps, PedalPace features an ** AI Tip** integration.:

> **AI Pro-Tip:** *"With a suitability score of 65, it's a solid day to ride, but those north-easterly gusts mean you should save your energy for the return leg. Bring a windbreaker!"*

### How it works:

1. **Data Layer**: Fetches raw JSON from **OpenWeather API**.
2. **Domain Layer**: The `ScoreCalculatorUseCase` turns raw data into a structured "Reasoning Payload."
3. **AI Layer**: Using **Gemini** to gennerate a specialized "Cycling Tip".

##  Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

You will need API keys from:

* [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (Current & Forecast)
* [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) (Gemini API)

### 2. Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PedalPace.git

```


2. Add your keys to the `local.properties` file:
```properties
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

```


3. Sync Gradle and run the app on your device or emulator.
